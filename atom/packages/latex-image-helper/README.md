# Latex Image Helper

An Atom plugin for Latex grammar. Create image file relative to the Latex file and insert a relative url to that file.

## Installation
Place in `~/.atom/packages`

## Usage
1. Take a screenshot or copy any image to the clipboard.
2. Paste it into Atom Latex editor
3. See that an directory name "images" was created, and the directory has a png file, and a url was inserted.

## Credits
This plugin is based on bigyuki's Markdown image helper, slightly modified for my needs.

## Attention
You may have to edit the paths in line 27 and 37 if you use the Latex parent documents feature.
