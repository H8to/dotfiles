An Atom plugin for Latex grammar. Create image file relative to the Latex file and insert a relative url to that file.

Place in `~/.atom/packages`

## Usage
1. Take a screenshot or copy any image to the clipboard.

3. See that an directory name "images" was create, and the directory has a png file, and a url was inserted.

This plugin is based on bigyuki's Markdown image helper, slightly modified for my needs.
